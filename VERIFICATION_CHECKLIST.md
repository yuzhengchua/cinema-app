# SonarCloud Project Verification Checklist

## Task: Check if project has been created on SonarCloud

### Steps to Verify:

1. **Access SonarCloud Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://sonarcloud.io/
   - Log in with GitHub credentials

2. **Check if Project Exists**
   - Navigate to: https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=yuzhengchua_cinema-app
   - OR search for "cinema-app" in the projects list
   - Expected Organization: `yuzhengchua`
   - Expected Project Key: `yuzhengchua_cinema-app`

3. **Verification Status**

   ✅ **If Project EXISTS:**
   - The project is already set up
   - Verify the GitHub Actions secret `SONAR_TOKEN` is configured
   - Next CI run will automatically analyze code
   
   ❌ **If Project DOES NOT EXIST:**
   - Follow the instructions in `SONARCLOUD_SETUP.md` to create the project
   - Import the repository from GitHub
   - Configure the `SONAR_TOKEN` secret in GitHub repository settings
   - Trigger a CI run to perform first analysis

### Alternative Verification Methods:

#### Method 1: Check GitHub Actions Workflow Run
- If `SONAR_TOKEN` secret is configured and project exists
- Push a commit and check the CI workflow
- The "SonarCloud Scan" step should succeed

#### Method 2: Use SonarCloud API (requires token)
```bash
curl -u YOUR_SONAR_TOKEN: \
  "https://sonarcloud.io/api/projects/search?projects=yuzhengchua_cinema-app"
```

Expected response if project exists:
```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "key": "yuzhengchua_cinema-app",
      "name": "Cinema Booking Application",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Method 3: Check CI Workflow
- View latest GitHub Actions run at: https://github.com/yuzhengchua/cinema-app/actions
- If the "SonarCloud Scan" step fails with "Project not found", the project needs to be created
- If the step fails with "Authentication failed", the SONAR_TOKEN needs to be configured

## Summary

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Code is configured for SonarCloud integration
- ✅ All configuration files are in place
- ❓ SonarCloud project existence needs manual verification
- ❓ GitHub Actions secret `SONAR_TOKEN` needs to be configured

**What's Been Done:**
1. Added SonarCloud Maven plugin to `pom.xml`
2. Created `sonar-project.properties` with project configuration
3. Updated GitHub Actions workflow to include SonarCloud scan
4. Added JaCoCo code coverage integration
5. Created comprehensive setup documentation

**What Needs to Be Done:**
1. Manually verify if the SonarCloud project exists on https://sonarcloud.io/
2. If not exists, create the project following `SONARCLOUD_SETUP.md`
3. Configure the `SONAR_TOKEN` GitHub secret
4. Trigger a CI run to perform the first analysis
